# Chrome_Simple_Drawing_Extension


This repository contains a Chrome extension that allows users to draw on top of the content of their active tab. 

The extension includes a background script (background.js), a content script (content.js), and an icon image (icon.png). The manifest file (manifest.json) specifies the extension's permissions and details.

This extension can be useful for demonstrating something on a screen during a video call, as it allows the user to draw or highlight certain elements on the page for the benefit of the other participants. To use the extension, the user can click on the extension's icon in the browser's toolbar to toggle the drawing layer on or off. The user can then switch between drawing and erasing modes using the switch button that appears on the page, and draw or erase by clicking and dragging their mouse on the page.

To use this extension, you must set the extension's permissions in your browser to allow it to access and modify website data "on click." This will allow the extension to run and make changes to the content of your active tab when you activate it by clicking on the extension's icon in the browser's toolbar.
